# Implementation of the RRT Algorithm in C++

RRT- Rapidly growing Random Trees is a path planning algorithm, given a start point, goal point, obstacles, incrementing distance, goal radius (or tolerance).

## Installation

Download the path_planning.cpp file and run it using an appropriate IDE with the C++ packages.

## Usage

1. Enter the coordinates of the start and goal points. 
2. Enter the incremental distance.
3. Enter the number of rectangular obstacles.
4. Enter the bottom left and top right corner coordinates for each of these obstacles.
5. Enter the number of iterations.
6. Enter the goal radius (tolerance).
7. Outputted list of points can be plotted using special C++ packages like the vcpkg.
